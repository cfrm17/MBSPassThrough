Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) are essentially interest rate derivatives, this requires both a robust interest rate model as well as a model for the prepayment behavior. The prepayment model is dynamic, since prepayments depend very strongly on the dynamics of prevailing mortgage rates. These mortgage rate dynamics are driven by the dynamics of the yield curve.
